# Introduction

> To design and compare a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) for waste classification using the TrashNet dataset, which consists of images of various waste categories such as glass, paper, plastic, metal, cardboard, and trash.

## Objectives

- Develop a FCNN, CNN, and QCNN for waste classification using the TrashNet dataset.

- Evaluate and compare the performance of each model on various metrics.

- Investigate the impact of quantum-inspired approaches on waste classification by implementing a QCNN and exploring its performance relative to classical models.

- Assess the feasibility of quantum machine learning in environmental applications, particularly in waste management, and understand the advantages and limitations of QCNNs in this context.
